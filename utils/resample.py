              It is the ratio with the input sampling rate that is

               set things up so passing the dtype isn't necessary)

              filter function.  More is more accurate, but 64 is already
              quite a lot. The kernel size is 2*num_zeros + 1.
          cutoff_ratio: The filter rolloff point as a fraction of the
             Nyquist frequency.
